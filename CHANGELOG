# Change log

## 0.5.0

- Forked from `django-jackfrost` and renamed `staticpub`.

## Unreleased Jackfrost changes

- Added a `--dry-run` argument to the `collectstaticsite` management command to preview
  changes using the standard Django server, without writing anything to the storage
  backend.
- Moved `jackfrost.utils.build_page_for_obj` and `jackfrost.utils.eventlog_write` to
  `receivers` to better represent their use as signal listeners.
- Raise an error if a URL doesn't end with a slash or a file extension.

## 0.4.0

- Added `signals.write_page` which is fired after the storage backend has written the
  content.
- Added `utils.eventlog_write` for using [pinax.eventlog][] and the aforementioned
  `write_page` signal to track built items.
- Added a [ModelAdmin action][] for building a selection of model instances into their
  static counterparts, from the admin changelist.
- Made the receiver `utils.build_page_for_obj` actually work.
- The `models` module will be compiled using Cython, if installed.

## 0.3.0

  which allows models to add every URL they want to cause to be visited.

## 0.2.1

- Added support for Django 1.6
- Added celery tasks for building both a single URL, and all URLs.

## 0.2.0
